# Bar Gelateria Oasi

## Code Institute:Milestone Project 1

*Bar Gelateria Oasi* is a real bar opened in my home village.
The reason that moved me to make its website is linked to my work experience, that started in that bar when i was 16,
and i wanted to create a website that is personalized and consistent with the story of the company and its products
in a way that could be relevant for the customers and with a simple structure easy to navigate in.

As a greedy internet user i really love the encounter with simple and complete websites going straight to the point of my needs 
and curiosities.
Thanks to what i learnt during the *Code Institute* course and following the advices of my mentor, Seun Owonikoko,
i kept a consistent design and structure of the content using the learnt languages HTML5,CSS3 and adding a few lines of JS to have a clearer navbar during the navigation
through the readable content.
The goal was to complete a responsive and interactive website based on the User Experience principles.

This was the first of four Milestone Projects in the Full Stack Web Development Program i am attending at *The Code Institute*.

## UX

### Main aims

- To create a website that is speaking directly to the viewer, giving a clear idea and description of the company we are visiting.

- To make the website interactive through a form that allows customers with special needs to explain themselves. 

- To make it easy for the mobile users that visit the bar during the Virus Times by tapping on the shopping-cart and bring them in the Menu page, making them able to make their choice, 
  so the company can avoid to provide Menu's of common use.

-To create a responsive design fitting all devices and screen sizes.


### Customers' Reviews
- The Customers' Reviews motivated me to create a website that transmitted the same enthusiasm people have when visiting the company.

#### New Customers Comments

- It is the first time i come to Bolsena and found this Bar on the lakefront walk, amazing icecream, and professional service.

- I live in a little village far away from the bigger ones, but when i asked the owner if it was possible to have things delivered he adjusted the
  delivery route and found a day of the Week to come to my house, awesome!

#### Regular Customers Comments

- Every time a come to Bolsena for a Summer walk i stop at Bar Oasi, its excellent icecream and the prices of beverage and food, definetly below average, make it my choice every time. Absolutely recommended.

- Do not miss the opportunity to have an excellent icecream made with passion and care by David, on the lakefront of Bolsena!

### Design Process

1. Strategy plane: I started based on the need to tell the full story of a company making use of my experience as a worker, as a customer and as an internet user. The UX experience was entirely focused on non-expert internet users, and making them possible to orientate themselves in a simple design and provide them the service they wanted, my older relatives were my model.

2. Scope plane: Once decided the users i wanted to be able to reach, i followed the instructions in the course and of my mentor to create a consistent website that could be simple and reliable to navigate : making every page with a similar central opening picture, well structured and consistent widths of the sections, to achieve a smooth scrolling of the content and a form to satisfy special occasion needs.

3. Structure plane : When i knew wich features i wanted for the website i decided to create the pages: - 'Home', to welcome the customer with a story of the product and the company's experience.
                                                                                                       - ''
